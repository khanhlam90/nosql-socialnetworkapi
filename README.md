# NoSQL - Social Network API

![Github License](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=License&message=MIT&color=blue&style=for-the-badge)

## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

As a full-stack developer, I am able to use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. This project application's foundation is about data, therefore, it is important for me to understand how to build and staructure the API first.

This projects is built from an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routing, a [MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/), and the [Mongoose ODM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose). In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, it uses a JavaScript date library to format timestamps.

User Story
- AS A social media startup
- I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
- SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a social network API
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
